## Abstract
- T-shaped molecules are designed in such a way that they self-organize into nanoscale liquid crystalline honeycombs based on polygons with any chosen number of sides.
One of the phases reported here is a periodic organization of identical pentagonal cylinders; the other one is a structure composed of square-shaped and triangular cylinders in the ratio 2:1.
These two different packing motifs represent duals of the same topological class.
The generalization of the concept applied here allows the prediction of a whole range of unusual complex liquid crystalline phases.`[2]`
-  T-shaped polyphilic triblock molecules, consisting of a rodlike p-terphenyl unit,
a hydrophilic and flexible laterally attached oligo(oxyethylene) chain terminated by an 1-acylamino-1-deoxy-D-sorbitol unit,
and two end-attached lipophilic alkyl chains, have been synthesized by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions as the key steps.

## Introduction
- Considerable progress in the fabrication of quasicrystals demonstrates that they can be realized in a broad range of materials.
However, the development of chemistries enabling direct experimental observation of early quasicrystal growth pathways remains challenging. `[5]`

- The shapes of the frameworks are determined primarily by the curvature of the interface between the two incompatible liquids \ref{ZengScience2011},
hence they form a limited range of closed- or open-cell structures, typically micellar cubic or hexagonal.

- With the development of chemical synthetic technology in polymer science, design and realize diverse and multilevel structures are achievable.
Among various manipulable materials, Block copolymer is a powerful platform for Scientist to realize their design,
such as self-assembly into difference morphology to satisfy difference function and character.
The morphology and structure can be regulated by molecular parameter such as volume fraction ($f_i$), interaction $\chi N_{ij}$,
where $\chi$ represent the chemical repulsion between different components.
However, the morphologies and the scale of traditional blocks copolymer is unable to satisfy the growing demand in research and industry.

- One of the fascinating aspects of beehive honeycombs is their nearly perfect hexagonal structure.
Although it is intuitively "obvious" that this is the way to pack cylinders with the minimum wall area,
the mathematical proof came only recently.
Whether we look at living tissue or the organization of nanoparticles, molecules, or atoms, one can find numerous examples of hexagonal patterns.
The situation is different for pentagons.
However, snugly fitting pentagons can tile the sphere, either by themselves (pentagonal dodecahedron) or in combination with hexagons Ee.g.,
fullerenes or supermolecules like polyoxometallates.
In contrast, tiling of a flat plane by identical pentagons can be achieved only if regular pentagons are mixed with other polygons in a nonperiodic arrangement EPenrose tilings or if they
contain at least two different angles and side lengths.
The latter is difficult to realize on a molecular scale with the rather strongly fixed angles and distances dictated by covalent bonding and coordination of standard chemical building blocks
Hence, only a nonplanar two-dimensional (2D) net of pentagons has been realized with a coordination polymer (10).
We show that the liquid crystalline state (11), which combines order and mobility, provides the necessary degree of flexibility for the realization of pentagonal honeycombs.`[2]`
- Usually, the columnar LCs have a column center composed of more-or-less rigid aromatic groups, surrounded by flexible chains.
This most often results in a hexagonal 2D periodicorganization,and sometimes in adistorted variant, i.e., rectangular or oblique.`[2]`
-  Here, in order to create honeycomb-like network structures,
the intention is for the rigid rod-like groups to form the outer frame of polygons,
with the interior being filled with just enough volume of flexible chains that the perimeter should equal the combined length of a discrete number of rods. 
The molecules meant to give rise to these LC structures are designed in such a way that the organization favored by their shape
is in competition with the drive for microsegregation of their different incompatible parts (amphiphilicity).`[2]`
- The T-shaped facial amphiphiles 1 and 2 are examples of such molecules.
They contain three incompatible segments, a rodlike aromatic core, two terminal lipophilic and flexible alkyl chains, and a polar group in a lateral position. `[2]`
- In this report, another class of ternary block molecules is described in which the position of amphiphilic groups is reversed;
that is, the polar group is attached to a lateral position on the rigid core(1,1-41-terphenyl units in all cases),
and the lipophilic chains are tethered at the termini.`[3]`
-  The evolution of mesophase structures is monitored in a systematic way as a function of length of the terminal alkyl chains
and as a function of the number of oxyethylene units in the polar chains.
In addition, the effects of the position of the polar group, of branching of the alkyl chains, and of the nonsymmetric distribution of these chains at both ends are reported.`[3]`

## Theory and Method


## Results and Discussion
-  The amplitudes of the Fourier transformation of the density profile for the A component is identified, shown in Figure 3a,
in a similar way discussed for other structures by Erukhimovich et al. The plot is consistent with a real XRD pattern obtained experimentally, shown in plot (b) `[4]`
- This Col squ /p4gm phase is also made up of cylinders, but in this case with a pentagonal cross-sectional shape.
The polar lateral chains fill the interior of these cylinders, and the columns of the alkyl chains interconnect the cylinder walls.
These pentagonal cylinders can only organize in a regular and periodic way if they form cylinder pairs (indicated by dotted green lines in Figure 8b).
These pairs have symmetry higher than that of the individual pentagonal cylinder and adopt a 90°turn herringbone-like packing, leading to the p4gm-lattice.`[3]`
- Hence, as shown in Figure 2, elongation of the polar lateral chain leads to a transition from simple layers via hexagonal channeled layers to a square cylinder structure.`[3]`
- The X-ray diffraction pattern of the aligned mesophase of compound A10/4 is shown in Figure 5a.
In the wide-angle region, a diffuse outer scattering indicates the liquid crystal nature of the phase.
In the small-angle region, **the sharp reflections (10, 11, and 01) can be indexed on the basis of a p4mm lattice with the lattice parameter a=4.0 nm**.`[3]`
- All of these optical, rheological, and crystallographic data are **in line with** a hexagonal channeled layer phase (ChL hex ).
This mesophase was recently investigated in detail, and the structure (Figure 3c) was confirmed by electron density calculations using high-resolution scattering data.
Accordingly, this mesophase consists of alternating layers of aromatic units and aliphatic chains,
penetrated at right angles by columns with undulating profiles containing the polar lateral groups (Figure 3c).`[3]`
-  Compound A10/0, in which the carbohydrate unit is directly coupled to the rigid terphenyl core,
shows a simple smectic (SmA) phase, as indicated by the typical texture
(fanlike texture and optically isotropic homeotropic alignment after shearing can be seen between crossed polarizers)
and X-ray diffraction pattern (layer reflection and diffuse scattering in the wide-angle region).
In this liquid crystalline phase, the molecules are organized in layers, where the terphenyl units are arranged,
on average, perpendicular to the layer planes but without in-plane order.
These sublayers are separated by layers of alkyl chains.
- With increasing length of this chain, the transition temperatures decrease, and three different LC phases are observed: SmA, ChL hex, and Col_squ/p4mm.`[3]`
- The flexible polyether chain has two functions: it increases the size of the lateral group and decouples the carbohydrate unit from the rigid core,
thus reducing the melting point and broadening the LC range.`[3]`
- Compound 1, which has a rather large lateral group, displays two different liquid crystallinephases(Table1).
In addition to a hexagonal columnar high-temperature phase (lattice parameter a hex 0 4.4 nm at T 0 106-C; figs. S5 and S6 and table S2),
a square columnar phase was identified by textural observations (Fig. 1A) and x-ray diffraction from aligned samples.`[2]`
- The diffraction pattern of the square columnar phase (Fig. 1B; fig. S4 and table S1) can be indexed on the plane group p4gm with a lattice parameter.`[2]`
- This Col squ /p4gm phase has an unexpectedly large unit cell (19) formed by the organization of about 25 or 26 molecules.`[2]`
- Pair formation is required only if the individual single columns cannot tile the plane regularly,
and hence it was deduced that this mesophase is made up of polar columns, around which the terphenyl units indeed form pentagonal shells.`[2]`
- The reconstructed electron density map of the p4gm phase of 1 (Fig. 1C) confirms the suggested model.`[2]`
- The high-electron density regions (polar chains, shown in blue and purple) form pentagons that are separated by squares and triangles of low electron density
(yellow to red color), which contain the alkyl chains.`[2]`
-  The polar lateral chains form columns that are framed by four aromatic terphenyl cores.
The lipophilic terminal alkyl chains form separate columns interconnecting the aromatic cores end-to-end to yield the overall structure,
representing a simple square honeycomb.`[2]`
- In contrast to these rigid ternary amphiphiles, flexible ternary amphiphiles, such as ABC star triblock copolymers,
can form hexagonal and square columnar arrangements(27–29), but not pentagonal ones.
Another interesting feature of these mesophase morphologies is their topological duality.
The nodes and tiles within the pentagonal tiling of 1 can be exchanged,
and this leads to a mesophase structure comprising a regular organization of square and triangular columns for compound 2.
In addition to this topological duality, the exchange of the polar and nonpolar regions leads also to morphological isomerism, designated as color isomers.`[2]`

### Choose parameters

- The chain volume to molecular core length ratios were chosen such that triangular or square cells were expected in compounds B and hexagonal cells were expected in A.`[1]`

### Figure 

- Complete segregation of the side chains of X-shaped molecules into different columns, resulting in two-color tilings (Fig. 1, F and G),
should be possible for triangular and square cells, where "color" refers to the composition of the honeycomb cell interior. `[1]`
- This is illustrated in Fig. 1H. `[1]`

# 叙述

## 新现象
- Because of the large difference in area between an equilateral triangle and a square (a factor of 2.3),
compounds with side chains larger than those in B2, such as B3,
experience additional geometrical frustration of triangular cells being too small and square ones being too large.
A compromise single-color honeycomb in T-shaped LCs was reported to contain both triangles and squares in a ratio of 2: 1 (6).
However, the structure in X-shaped compound B3 must simultaneously relieve the frustrations of its side chains being both oversized for triangular cells and mutually incompatible.
B3 was found to display two new LC honeycombs of unusual complexity, separated by a first-order transition at 167°C.`[1]`

## 分类

- Two uniform colorings of the partially phase-separated hexagonal structure are possible, one three-color [p3m1 symmetry (Fig. 1I)] and the other two color [p6mm (Fig. 1J)].`[1]`
- Among the many LC phases of the T-shaped compounds are a series of honeycombs.`[1]`
- The recent example of kagome LC tiling, supported by simulation, hints at the potential for substantial expansion of the range
of honeycomb structures using X-shaped molecules bearing two different side chains.`[1]`

## 因果

- The fact that only diffuse x-ray scattering is observed in the range of interatomic distances (d < 0.6 nm, fig. S4),
as well as the typical optical textures (fig. S1), confirm the LC character of both phases.

## 论据

- The above is further supported by atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM).

# Notes
- Use a comma before the coordinating conjunction in a series of words, phrases, or clauses of equal rank containing three or more items. (This comma is called the serial comma.)
- In a series of items with the same article (a/an/the), keep the first, and remove the rest.
- In English grammar, a comma splice or comma fault is the use of a comma to join two independent clauses. Comma splices are usually considered style errors in English.
- Most prefixes are not hyphenated when added to words that are not proper nouns.
- Run-on sentences occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a coordinating conjunction (i.e., for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or correct punctuation (i.e., comma, semicolon, dash, or period).
- Comma splice: In English grammar, a comma splice or comma fault is the use of a comma to join two independent clauses. Comma splices are usually considered style errors in English.
- Use a comma after most introductory words and phrases. (Thus,)
