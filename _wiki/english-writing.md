- It is comparatively easy to do sth

# 语法

## 主谓一致

- none 可代单数也可代复数，后面的动词与代替的单复数保持一致
- data, criteria, phenomena, media 为复数，对应单数形式为datum, criterion, phenomenon, medium

## 修饰词同主语关系一致

- 动名词 (gerund)
  - After finishing the purification, the of the isolated of the isolated compound was then studied.
  - After purification was finished, the activity of the isolated of the isolated compound was then studied.

- 分词短语 (participle)
  - The iron concentration was determined using the Fenton reaction method.
  - The iron concentration was determined by the Fenton reaction method.

- 不定时短语 (infinitive)
  - To further investigate the potential role of biking in causing infertility, an expanded population of biking athletes was surveyed.
  - 改为: To further investigate the potential role of biking in causing infertility, we surveyed an expand population of biking athletes.

- 主语和主语的行动（谓语）在逻辑上要一致
  - The highest antibiotic production (production yield) was obtained at 48h.
  - The activity (assay of activity) of hydroxyl radicals was based on Fenton reaction.
  - The NMR spectra was performed (recorded) on a Varian 400 MHz instrument.

## 位置强调

- 英语写作中，强调的部分放在句子前面
- 但在科技论文写作中，一般把主句先写出来，除非想强调修饰的是条件
  - Through scavenging free radicals, antioxidants play an important role in protecting against complex diseases.
  - 改为: Antioxidants play an important role in protecting against complex diseases through scavenging free radicals.
  - 主动句中事情的执行者放在前面，强调事情的执行者；若要强调研究的事物，采用被动句，这也是为什么科技论文中被动句用的比较多。

- 修饰词和被修饰词要邻近
  - 原则：多个修饰词同时修饰时，一般把最窄的定义写在前面，最广的定义写在后面。修饰词与被修饰对象要靠近。
  - Eg: Inhibition of acid B on xanthine oxidase was also reported.
    - 改为：Inhibition of xanthine oxidase by acid B was also reported.
  - Eg: Reducing power represents the electron donating capacity, which may serve as a significant indicator of potential antioxidant activity.
    - 改为：Reducing power, which may serve as a significant indicator of potential antioxidant activity, represents the electron donating capacity.

- 主语和谓语位置要靠近
  - Eg. Lincomycin, one of the lincosamide antimicrobial agents that were first isolated more than fifty years ago, is used as a major antibiotic for the treatment of diseases caused by most Gram-positive bacteria.
    - 改为：Lincomycin is one of th lincosamide antimicrobial agents that were first isolated more than fifty years ago. It is used as a major antibiotic for the treatment of diseases caused by most Gram-positive bacteria.

## 时态
- Abstract讲述自己的实验和结论要用过去时
- Introduction中总结文献核问题，以现在时为主，也用一些过去时
- Method和Results中讲自己的实验和结果，用过去时
- Discussion中交换使用现在时和过去时。
- 引述文献结果时，过去发表的结论认为是已经被承认的事实，用现在时
- 引述过去的实验时，特别是以作者为主语时，因是过去做的事情，应该用过去时。
- 描述自己的试验和结果时，用过去时
- 讲述table和figure中显示的结果时，用现在时
- 计算的结果和统计分析结果应该用现在时。

## 数字
- 小于 10 的整数用英文字 (one, two...)，大于或等于10的数字用阿拉伯数字；
- 有小数点和单位的数字用阿拉伯数字；
- 在句子开头的数字用英文字，如果是有单位的表示数量的数字，通常不放在句首，而是放在括号中；
- 当两个数字前后并列出现时，一个要用英文字；
- 小于1的数字的单位用单数，大于1的数字的单位用复数， 0.25 gram, 0.8 second, 3.45 seconds，（单位单复数相同， mL）。

## 冠词
- 除了第一个词，题目中的冠词（the, a, an）不大写。

## 同位语
- 同位语应该同修饰的事物等位，说明什么，而不能用来解释要修饰的事物的性质。
  - Eg. The hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, a neurological disorder associated with iron accumulation, has been linked to a decline in cysteine dioxygenase activity. (同位语放在修饰的事物后面，用逗号分开，主语和谓语可以不靠近)
  - Eg: A novel compound, cyclic hexamethylidyne, has been synthesized.
  - Eg: Penicilline, not stable in water, was developed during WW11. (不恰当)

## 多余用词
- Eg. The results of activities of tested compounds are listed in Table 1.
  - 改为：The activities of tested compounds are listed in Table 1.
- it should be mentioned, it should be pointed out, it was found, it was determined. 都是冗长和委婉的说法，应该直接说明。

## 隔离
- 以下例子中的字必须连接在一起，不能被隔离。
  - Eg: The almost same activity.   (Almost the same activity)
  - Have extensively been studied (have been extensively studied or have been studied extensively)
  - To carefully examine the structure activity relationship (To examine the structure activity relationship carefully)

## 单位
- 数字和单位之间保留一个空格；
  - The singular and plural forms of a symbol are the same;
  - Symbols for derived units formed from multiple units by multiplication are joined with a space or center dot. (N m, N·m)


## 连接句子
- 结果关系
  - therefore
  - consequently
  - thus
  - hence
  - as a result
  - indeed
- 同等关系
  - furthermore
  - moreover
  - also
  - in addition
  - besides
  - also, too, likewise表示新引进的事物同前面的同等重要，只是语气不同，too比较随意，also比较正式，likewise更正式。
  - in addition, moreover, furthermore 多用于强调新引进的事物的重要性。
- 相反关系
  - in contrast
  - but
  - however
  - yet
  - on the other hand
  - surprisingly
  - nevertheless
  - instead
- 相似关系

  - likewise
  - Eg: For example, for instance, specifically, such as, including
- 时间
  - since then
  - after that
  - now
  - later
- 顺序
  - then
  - next
  - finally
  - first
  - second

## 组织平行句
- 当一步一步描写实验操作时，可以把几个动词合并到一个句子中
  - 只有两个动词时，and连接
  - 当有三个以上动词时，每个动词用逗号分开，最后一个动词前面加and，and前面加逗号。
  - Eg: The combined extract was filtrated and then condensed at 50-60. The condensed extract was precipitated with ethanol (final concentration at 70%) over night, and then the supernatant was collected, concent, rated in vacuum (40) to evaporate the solvent.
    - 改为：The combined aqueous extract was filtrated, condensed at 50-60, and precipitated with ethanol (to a final ethanol concentration of 70% ) over night. The supernatant was then collected and concentrated in vacuum (40).

  - Eg: Steptolydigin was extracted from the supernatant fluid by adding ethyl acetate with the ratio 1:1. The extracts were combined, and the solvents were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the oily residues were redissolved in 5 Ml of methanol. Then the methanol solution of extracts was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter for HPLC analysis and was stored at -20 ℃ until being analyzed.
    - 改为：Steptolydigin was extracted from the liquid layer with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The extracts were then combined and concentrated under reduced pressure.

- It is likely that, at this stage,
- P3BHT can be viewed as an "amphiphilit" rod-coil block copolymer with a solvophilic coil-like P3HT block and a solvophobic rod-like P3BT block,
  defined by the poorer solubility of P3BT block in the anisole/chloroform>6:1 solution.
- It is likely that…
- at this stage
- 表达“研究了…揭示了什么事实…"

- elucidate(阐释)在表达“获得，得到”含义时，多在表征手段得到某数据
- 表达时候，用的动词：
  - Collect(on)   operate(using a …)   perform(on)   record(with)   obtain

  - Spontaneous curvature
- rational:合理的
- notably(显而易见的，明显的）
- similarly(相似的）
- additionally  &  In addition "加之，又"
- （quite）Intriguingly(引起兴趣的）
- conversely(相反地）
- consequently(结论是…）
- considerably 表达“相当地… "
  - eg： The absorption spectrum in the solution is considerably red shifted, signifying a higher …
  - eg: These properties are considerably determined by both the conformation of the …
- virtually 事实上
- intriguingly : 引起兴趣的， 用在实验中发现的新奇有意思的地方
- while
  - 有表达对比的意思
  - While I was taking care of our baby, she was out with her friends and didn't come back until midnight.我在看孩子的时候她跟朋友在外头玩儿到半夜才回来。
- but
  - eg: I want to have dinner, but I have to take a shower first.
- however 和but的意思很接近，只是更为正式一些。I don't want to have dinner. However, watching a movie together would be great.
- nevertheless是尽管。。。，而。。。，举个例子：I know everybody hates him. Nevertheless, I have decided to marry him.我知道大家都不喜欢他。就算这样，我要是要嫁给他。

- but,however,still,yet,nevertheless,while,whereas

  - 这些连词或副词均含“但是，可是，然而，而”之意。 but口语常用词，语气较强，泛指与前述情况相反。 however表转折关系，语气稍弱于but，连接性也弱一些，因而常作插入语。 still语气强，多用于肯定句或疑问句。指尽管作出让步，采取措施或表示反对，但情况仍然如故，无所改变。 yet常用于否定句，语气比still稍强。指不管作出多大努力或让步，仍达不到预期的结果。 nevertheless指尽管作出完全让步，也不会发生任何影响。 while表对比，一般可与whereas换用，但程度弱一些。 whereas表对比，一般可与while互换。


- therefore和so用法的区别
  - therefore 就是因此的意思 后面要紧跟一个句子 后面没有逗号
  - so 可以说是所以的意思 后面可以加逗号 再加句子
  - 另外,不能because...so 也不能because...therefore
  - 在含义上,因此/所以,基本无区别
  - 但是考试的时候 最好用therefore 别用so
  - 因为so比较简单,显得文章水平低 而用therefore会显得你的作文更好
- readily:容易地
  - eg: Lamellar aggregates are not readily observed in block copolymer solutions as there are likely to phase separate out of the solution or rather form curved analogous like vesicles.
- likewise：同样地
- allowing:
- ultimately :最终
- Be of importance （for)  :…是重要的
  - Eg: The optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers are of importance for their application in organic electronic devices.
- to the best of our knowledge : 据我们所知…
- up to now : 到目前为止
